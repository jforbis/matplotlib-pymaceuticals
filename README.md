# SCC Tumor Development Over Time via Multiple Drug Regimen (in mice)

In this study we took 249 mice and monitored squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) tumor growth. Measurements were taken every 5 days for all mice, unless measurement was unable to be taken due to unforeseen factors. Additionally, the gender of mice was roughly equal throughout the study.

## Observations:
* Of the original 248 mice, only 130 of them lasted the entire length of the study.
* Regarding the four drug regimens that were honed in on (Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, & Ceftamin) it is apparent that both Capomulin and Ramicane had more of an effect on tumor volume than Infubinol and Ceftamin.
    * Further, Ramicane seemed to edge out Capomulin in terms of most positive effect on tumor volume, reducing tumor size down to a mean of 36.56 mm3.
* Of the four regimens listed above, there appears to only be one outlier from the innerquartile range (IQR). That outlier was with the drug regimen Infubinol.
* Finally, the correlation between mouse weight and tumor size was .88; meaning, it is likely that as mouse weight changes, so will tumor size.
