# Use groupby and summary statistical methods to calculate the following properties of each drug regimen: 
# mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume. 
# Assemble the resulting series into a single summary dataframe.

# ## Quartiles, Outliers and Boxplots

# %%
# Calculate the final tumor volume of each mouse across four of the treatment regimens:  
# Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin

# Start by getting the last (greatest) timepoint for each mouse


# Merge this group df with the original dataframe to get the tumor volume at the last timepoint


# %%
# Put treatments into a list for for loop (and later for plot labels)


# Create empty list to fill with tumor vol data (for plotting)


# Calculate the IQR and quantitatively determine if there are any potential outliers. 

    
    # Locate the rows which contain mice on each drug and get the tumor volumes
    
    
    # add subset 
    
    
    # Determine outliers using upper and lower bounds
    


# %%
# Generate a box plot of the final tumor volume of each mouse across four regimens of interest

# ## Line and Scatter Plots

# %%
# Generate a line plot of tumor volume vs. time point for a mouse treated with Capomulin


# %%
# Generate a scatter plot of average tumor volume vs. mouse weight for the Capomulin regimen

# %% [markdown]
# ## Correlation and Regression
